# Noelia Doman
- passionate about software programming and collaborative coding
- I live on a farm in the middle of the country surrounded by Amish. It is very quiet here! We moved here to pursue our interest in farming and raising livestock. My interest in animals came from my background as a farmer's daughter and as my current role as a Vet Tech (practicing for 10 years, going back to school to change my career!)
- I really enjoy reading and have a goal of 100-125 books this year.
## Technical Bakcground
I have minimal experience in C. Most of my experience is in Python. I find that I picked up Python much quicker than the other languages I have tried. I do not have a ton of technical experience at this time aside from what has been done in previous classes.
